### Background
The videogame industry is a multi-billion dollar industry and a significant part of the world economy. We investigated certain trends and patterns within this industry to better understand it. The specific relationships we were interested in are maturity rating and global sales, genre and Japanese sales, and console and genre. From this we were able to learn which maturity ratings of video games are the most successful in both global and Japanese economies, and to see if specific consoles are more prone to specific genres of games.


### Methods
We obtained our data from an online dataset called "Video Game Sales with Ratings" by Rush Kirubi from www.kaggle.com. With this dataset, we use chi-square significance tests to check if any maturity rating group outsells the rest, if any genre is more successful than the rest in the Japanese market and if any genre is more prevalent on a variety of different gaming systems.
